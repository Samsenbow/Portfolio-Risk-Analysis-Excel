# Portfolio-Risk-Analysis-Excel

This project analyzes a **hypothetical portfolio** constructed from three major stock indexes: **S&P 500, FTSE 100, and DAX**, using **two years of historical data**. Relevant **exchange rates** were also included to account for currency effects.  

The raw data was **extracted from Google Sheets using GOOGLEFINANCE function**, then **cleaned, converted, and prepared** for analysis. The project visualizes the **loss distribution** through a histogram and calculates statistical measures of risk. A **risk matrix** is created including **Value at Risk (VaR)** and **Expected Shortfall (ES)**.

This project is inspired by the **Risk Management Specialization course on Coursera**.
